# Google-Map-Location-Marker
In this project we have used Google map API's to mark locations on it. It is possible to temporarily mark few locations using red location pins.

Initially I had marked five states of India (West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Nagaland and Mizoram).

If the user clicks on these pins it shows which location is it pointing to

Now say I want to mark locations of New Delhi, Kanpur, Ranchi Kolkata all I need to do is click on the location I want to add a marker to.
